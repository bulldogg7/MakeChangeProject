# MakeChangeProject

## Description
	- Create a cash register program to input an item price and cash tendered from the customer. 
	Calculate the change due and the bills and coins to return to the customer. 
	Make it so that it repeats so that once a transaction is completed it will take another transaction.

## Technologies Used
	- Java
	- Eclipse
	- Sublime
	- Git/GitHub
	- MacOS Terminal

## Lessons Learned
	- Always commit your work so that it saves
	- Learned about DecimalFormal in order to force .00 on whole number cash inputs 
	and remove .0 on the number of bills and coins to return as change

## Changes Made
	- Changed the input instruction to enter a number with a decimal so that if they 
	enter a whole number of cash received (100, 80, 50, 20, etc.) then it will add .00
	- Changed bill and coin amounts to remove the .0
